/**
 * This exercise adapts Twitter6 for Hadoop execution:
 *   1. It runs the third pipe with the limit clause that crashes in local mode.
 *   2. It configures the number of reducers to prevent an excess number being
 *      invoked.
 * To run it, you need to have the Scalding distribution installed, e.g., cloned
 * form GitHub, and built. Then you use the "scripts/scald.rb" script in the 
 * distribution. You also need Hadoop installed and running using 
 * pseudo-distributed mode or local mode your laptop.
 * For example, let's assume the Scalding distribution directory shares the same 
 * parent as the workshop directory and you're running the Hadoop services in
 * pseudo-distributed mode. Run the following commands, starting in the workshop
 * directory:
 *   # Put the workshop data directory in your HDFS home directory:
 *   hadoop fs -put data data
 *   ../scalding/scripts/scald.rb --hdfs-local --host localhost \
 *     scripts/HadoopTwitter11.scala \
 *     --input  data/twitter/tweets.tsv \
 *     --uniques output/unique-languages \
 *     --count_star output/count-star \
 *     --count_star_limit output/count-star-limit
 * If you're on a real cluster, replace "localhost" with the correct name.
 * The output directory will also be in your HDFS home directory.
