 * This exercise uses the CoGroup feature. CoGroups in Cascading are really the basis
 * for joins, where two or more pipes are joined and grouped by join keys. Here we
 * use it joining more than two pipes, since the join methods only support two-way
 * joins.
 * We'll join four stocks together by date, showing their closing price:
 *   AAPL, INTC, GE, and IBM
 * You invoke the script like this:
 *   run.rb scripts/StockCoGroup5.scala \
 *     --input  data/stocks \
 *     --output output/AAPL-INTC-GE-IBM.txt
